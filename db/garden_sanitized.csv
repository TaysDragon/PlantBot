,Bluberry,Climax,,Late May?early June,450,,,"Concentrated ripening season; small?medium
fruit","Pollenizers: Austin, Premier",,,,,,,,,,,,"Nitrogen fertilizer for blueberries in Texas is ammonium sulfate (21-0-0).
Ammonium sulfate is the most frequently recommended synthetic fertilizer for blueberries. It?s particularly suited for fertilizing blueberries because it tends to lower the pH of the soil. 

If your soil pH is naturally low (under 5.0), then a urea-based fertilizer will probably work best for you, since urea is not as acidifying as ammonium sulfate. 

When selecting a fertilizer for blueberries, be sure to only consider those that supply nitrogen in the ammonium form. Avoid using fertilizers that supply nitrogen in the form of nitrates, because that type of fertilizer can damage or even kill your blueberry plants. 


When selecting a fertilizer for blueberries, be sure to only consider those that supply nitrogen in the ammonium form. Avoid using fertilizers that supply nitrogen in the form of nitrates, because that type of fertilizer can damage or even kill your blueberry plants. 

But if you?re using organic fertilizers, you still need to be careful to use only fertilizers that will tend to lower pH ? or at least not raise it. Cottonseed meal and blood meal are examples of acidifying organic fertilizers, and both are recommended for blueberries. "

,Sapodilla,Makok,,"The sapodilla plant grows well in a warm and sunny and preferably frost free location.  Sapodilla trees prefer well-drained, sandy soil with regular applications of water to young trees. Once established they are very drought- and salt- tolerant. Sapodilla trees are tolerant of windy conditions and young trees generally do not have a problem with establishment on windy sites if they are pruned properly.

Addition of plant mulch to the soil surface will improve water-holding capacity, nutrient retention and availability and soil structure. Fertilization is best done with three applications per year (March, July and September) of an 8-3-9 or other fruit tree formulation.  Most mature sapodilla trees receive no watering, but irrigation in dry season may increase productivity.
Young sapodilla trees may be severely damaged or killed at 30 to 32øF (-1 to 0øC) or below but mature trees may withstand down to about 26øF (-3øC) for a few hours without major damage. 
Ripening Season for Makok: May-Nov.

The juicy, fiber free flesh is deep orange and aromatic, with a rich, spicy flavor. ?Fairchild? always ranks among the top cultivars in public evaluations at Fairchild?s annual International Mango Festival. The tree and fruit are highly tolerant of disease and fruit well under humid conditions, making it a natural for South Florida. The tree is among the most ornamental of mangos, with its compact shape and deep green color. It can be maintained at a height and spread of 8 ft. or less, perfect for those with a modest-sized home garden.",,,,,

The fruiting season is from May to July, but unpredictable, with multiple crops throughout the summer.

It is among the latest season mango and is highly tolerant of most diseases. The tree is easily manipulated by management and pruning and its size is influenced greatly by environment. ?Keitt? is a perfect choice for the late season in the home garden. In the moist, hot tropics it grows to a medium or large tree, whereas in many desert climates it is a sprawling tree or near shrub that may be grown on trellis wires. The fruit are commercially sold as mature-green fruit for Asian and Latin markets and there is an increase in the use of ?Keitt? for fresh cut due to the ability to cut with a bare minimum of maturity and maintain the ?mango? flavor.",,,,,

It has shown good wind tolerance in storms up to 50mph. It has a tendency to hold its leaves tight with short petioles. Fruit quality is considered one of the best.
